## Scripts

- `npm start` for auto-updating development server on `http://localhost:1234`
- `npm run build` for the development build

# Retros

## Mob one: 14 June 2023

### Positives

- Mob works well with Gather's rapid screen switching
- Gather works well in general: nice new office with lots of green space and a cat
- Phaser is intuitive; Infinite Jumper tutorial is easy to follow

### Next

- Next mob: Wednesday 21 June - aiming for mobs every Wednesday
- Mini-mob on weekend of 17/18 June
- Keep pitching game ideas

## Mob two: 18 June 2023

- Externalising game global parameters.
- Cool library and tools! Very easy to get set up.
- Keep pitching game ideas.
- 5 minute mobbing working very well.
- Gather is great!

### Next

- Next mob: Tuesday 20th June
- RPG for mobbing? Gregoreigler?

## Mob three: 20th June 2023 7pm

- First bit of debugging
- Being too strict on the "rules" can get in the way
- Five minutes felt too short
- For an idea to go from a person's head into the computer it must go through someone else's hands!
- Debugging is a real learning opportunity. The distance between what happened and what we expected to happen is a "learning space" üôÇ
- The "magical" `get` method on a Group is confusing

## Mob three and a half: 25th 12:30pm

- Bit more autonomous working today (as opposed to just following the tutorial).
- More relaxed approach to the mob timer - it's all about the 'flow'!
- VS Code has an outline feature üôÇ!
- Proposal for following guide in next session (Game Scene deep-dive).

## Mob four: 27th June 2023 7pm

- Andrzej and Pete practised TDD and "ping-pong" pairing in the cyber-dojo instead!
- We tried FizzBuzz in Ruby, using RSpec
- We completed a fizzbuzz() function but didn't quite manage to test drive a "1 to 100 printer"

## Mob four redux: 5th July 7pm
